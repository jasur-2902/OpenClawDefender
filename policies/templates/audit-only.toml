# ClawDefender Policy Template: Audit Only
#
# Logs every event without blocking or prompting. Use this policy when you
# want full visibility into what an AI agent is doing without any interference.
#
# Ideal for:
#   - Evaluating a new agent before writing restrictive policies
#   - Compliance and auditing in low-risk environments
#   - Debugging agent behavior
#
# Usage:
#   cp policies/templates/audit-only.toml ~/.config/clawdefender/policy.toml

# Single rule: log everything

# This catch-all rule matches every event and logs it. No actions are blocked
# or prompted. The audit log records all tool calls, resource accesses, and
# other MCP events for later review.
